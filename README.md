# BMI Calculator
## This is a simple BMI calculator coded with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
## This calculator computes the BMI value only after the user has given both his height and weight.
## If either of the value is missing, there will be an error message to prompt the user for the value.
## Once the conditions have been met, the calculator takes the given values and computes the BMI.
## The BMI is displayed at the bottom of the page along with the BMI status which ranges from Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese.
